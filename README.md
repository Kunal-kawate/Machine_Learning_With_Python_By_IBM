# Machine_Learning_With_Python_By_IBM

## Overview

Welcome to the "Machine Learning with Python by IBM" repository! ðŸŽ“

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my completion of the "Machine Learning with Python" course offered by IBM on Coursera. In this course, I gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in various aspects of machine learning, which are highlighted below.

## Course Highlights

Throughout the course, I learned to:

- **Describe Different Types of Machine Learning Algorithms**: Understand the various types of machine learning algorithms and when to use them effectively.
- **Compare and Contrast Linear Classification Methods**: Explore and differentiate between multiclass prediction, support vector machines, and logistic regression.
- **Implement Classification Techniques in Python**: Write Python code to implement various classification techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and regression trees.
- **Evaluate Regression Models**: Assess the results from simple linear, non-linear, and multiple regression on datasets using evaluation metrics.

## Certificate

I am proud to share my completion certificate for this course. You can view the certificate in this repository.

## Acknowledgements

I am thankful to IBM and Coursera for providing this excellent course. It has significantly enhanced my understanding and skills in machine learning, and I am excited to apply this knowledge to real-world projects!
